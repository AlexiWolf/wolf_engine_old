# Wolf Engine

Wolf Engine is a game library written in Rust with a focus on flexability and
ease of use.  It provides solid default options and tools for those who just
want to make their game while also getting out of the way of those who want to
do things their way.

### Features

**Note**  Wolf Engine is still very much a W.I.P, so you should expect missing
features, bugs, changing APIs, and other spooky stuff until release 1.0.

TODO: Feature checklist.

### Installation

Add Wolf Engine to your dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:

```TOML
[dependencies]
wolf_engine = "*"
```

### Getting Started

TODO: Write a "quick-start" guide.  I'm waiting to do this because the 
instructions will be chainging very soon.  Refer to the documentation in 
[lib.rs](src/lib.rs) for a current guide.

### License

Wolf Engine is licensed under either 

- [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE-APACHE)
