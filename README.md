Wolf Engine is a game framework that's designed to be flexible and easy to work with.

### Design Goals

- **Simple:** Offer sensible default options and a clean and simple API.  Always remember to KISS.
- **Capable:** Build anything from small prototypes and game jams to full-featured production releases.
- **Flexible:** Allow users the freedom to bring their own tools and customize the engine to fit their project's needs.
- **Stable:** Utilize Rust's powerful type system and good BDD / TDD practices to squash bugs before they appear.
- **Capable:** Provide 2D and 3D support and many more useful features.
- **Light:** Every module except the core module is optional, so if it's not needed it won't be included.
- **Fast:** Code should strive to run as fast as possible.
