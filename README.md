A simple, flexible, and easy-to-use game framework written in Rust.

## Status

Wolf Engine is currently in very early development.  You should expect missing features, bugs, changing APIs, and other
spooky stuff until release 1.0.

## Features

- [x] Simple, and flexible core API.
- [ ] Easy-to-use high-level Framework. 
- [ ] Graphics, audio, and window APIs.
- [ ] 2d and 3d graphics.

## Platform Support 

Excellent cross-platform support is one of the main goals of Wolf Engine.  The entirety of the engine, with
`--all-features` enabled, should work on Desktop (Windows, Linux, MacOS), Mobile (Android, iOS), and WASM. Failure to 
build / run on these platforms is considered a bug.  Please create a bug report if you run into any problems.

# Usage

- [The documentation](https://docs.rs/wolf_engine/latest/wolf_engine/) provides an overview of the engine, its APIs, 
  and how to use them. Start here.
- [The examples folder](https://github.com/AlexiWolf/wolf_engine/tree/main/examples) provides a range of examples for 
  various concepts.
