/// Provides a way to retrieve events from the [`Context`](crate::Context).
///
/// Under the hood, Wolf Engine consists of two main parts: The `EventLoop` (You are here!), and the
/// [`Context`](crate::Context`).  Together, these two parts make up what we refer to as
/// "the engine."
///
/// The Event-Loop is a specialized type of [`EventReceiver`].  Unlike a typical event receiver,
/// the Event-Loop will continually emit events for as long as the engine is running, even if there
/// are no events currently in the queue.  
///
/// When there are no queued events to emit, [`EngineEvent::EventsCleared`] is returned instead, so
/// long as the engine is running.  When [`EngineEvent::Quit`] is received, the event loop will
/// return `None` after the queue is cleared.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Events are queried using the [`EventReceiver`] API.
///
/// ```
/// # use wolf_engine_core as wolf_engine;
/// # use wolf_engine::prelude::*;
/// #
/// # let (mut event_loop, mut context) = wolf_engine::init().build();
/// #
/// while let Some(event) = event_loop.next_event() {
///     match event {
///         // Process events.
/// #       _ => (),
///     }
/// #   break;
/// }
